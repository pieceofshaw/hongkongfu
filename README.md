# Multi-page Mobile Site (GitHub Pages)

Pages: `index.html`, `gallery.html`, `audio.html`, `map.html`, `pay.html`  
Shared assets in `/assets`. Edit `style.css` to quickly change brand color / radius.

## Deploy
1) Upload all files in this folder to your repo root.
2) Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch (branch = main/master, folder = /).
3) Wait for build → Open https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO/

## Tips
- Put gallery images as img1.jpg, img2.jpg... in /assets
- First audio in /assets is preloaded; extra audio files appear as a playlist.
- Change map location by editing `q=` in `map.html` iframe.
